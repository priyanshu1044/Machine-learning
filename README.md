# 📈 Linear Regression with TensorFlow.js and p5.js

This project combines the power of the TensorFlow.js library for machine learning with the interactive visualization capabilities of the p5.js library.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Points:** Click on the canvas to add points dynamically.
- **Real-time Adjustment:** The program employs linear regression to fit a line to the points, adjusting in real-time as more points are added. This results in changes to the slope and y-intercept to minimize the distance to all points.
